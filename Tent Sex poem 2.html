<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">T</span>he pleasure they shared was beyond compare,</p></p>
<p>As Elisa's body yielded to his every touch and stare,</p>
<p>But outside their tent, people stood in a row,</p>
<p>Eagerly waiting for the sounds of their erotic show.</p>
<p>It was strange to have an audience for their intimate act,</p>
<p>But their passion was too strong for them to even react,</p>
<p>With every thrust, they forgot about the curious crowd,</p>
<p>As Elisa's moans filled the air, loud and proud.</p>
<p>Though the situation was quite bizarre,</p>
<p>Their pleasure was undeniable, reaching a new bar,</p>
<p>The sensation was like nothing they had ever felt before,</p>
<p>A connection that went beyond just physical, but to their core.</p>
<p>As they lay together in each other's embrace,</p>
<p>Elisa realized the importance of offering advice with grace,</p>
<p>For though their love was passionate and wild,</p>
<p>Sometimes it's best to help others, rather than act like a child.</p>
<p>So they parted ways, but the memories remained,</p>
<p>Of the night they made love, and their hearts gained,</p>
<p>And as Elisa looks back, she sees the lesson she learned,</p>

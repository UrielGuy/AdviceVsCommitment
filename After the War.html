<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">I</span>n the aftermath of the war to save Burning Man, Elisa, leader of House Hetmanski, returned to her homestead with her weary men. The grueling battles and the arduous journey had left them exhausted, their spirits dampened by the horrors they had witnessed. They longed for respite and the chance to rebuild their shattered lives.</p></p>
<p>Elisa's heart yearned for the comfort of her home, for the solace of familiar surroundings, and the warmth of her hearth. As she and her men settled into their routine, tending to wounds and restoring their strength, a shadow fell upon her haven. Jim, the charismatic leader of a local cult, emerged from the fringes of the community, his fanatical followers in tow.</p>
<p>The cult's beliefs were strange and unsettling to Elisa. They preached that the human body was an abomination, a vessel of sin that needed to be hidden from the wrath of the gods. The followers wore costumes, disguising their true selves from the judgment of the divine. Jim, driven by his fervent convictions, saw Elisa's return as an opportunity to rally more resources and people for a new campaign to save Burning Man.</p>
<p>But Elisa, wearied by the horrors of war and yearning for tranquility, was not willing to offer Jim the commitment and resources he desired. She understood the importance of the cause, but her heart longed for a respite from conflict, a chance to rebuild her own house and restore her people's strength.</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, Elisa explained to Jim that she could offer advice and guidance, but her people needed time to heal, to rebuild their homes and lives. Jim, blinded by zeal, refused to accept Elisa's decision. He saw her reluctance as a weakness, an opportunity to seize power and further his cause.</p>
<p>As the days wore on, tensions simmered within the community. Jim's followers, emboldened by their leader's arrogance, began to question Elisa's authority. They whispered words of dissent, sowing discord among her people. But Elisa, strong-willed and resolute, would not let her leadership be undermined.</p>
<p>When Jim made his move to stage a coup, hoping to wrest control from Elisa, he found himself facing a united front. Elisa's men, loyal and battle-hardened, stood beside her, refusing to let their leader be cast aside. A fierce battle ensued, but the outcome was swift and decisive.</p>
<p>As the coup crumbled, Jim was captured, his treachery exposed for all to see. Elisa, driven by a mix of justice and frustration, made a solemn proclamation. The crowd gathered to witness the turn of events, their emotions a tumultuous blend of relief and anger.</p>
<p>With a steady hand, Elisa ordered Jim's beheading. The execution was carried out in front of the crowd, a stark reminder of the consequences of crossing House Hetmanski. Jim's head, tarred and placed upon a spike, became a gruesome warning to all those who dared disturb Elisa's private time of healing and restoration.</p>
<p>With the threat quelled, Elisa resumed her pursuit of rebuilding her house. Her people, inspired by her leadership and fierce determination, rallied around her. They worked tirelessly, their collective strength rekindled, slowly breathing new life into House Hetmanski.</p>

<p>Objective:</p>
<p>The objective of Burning Man Builders is to provide helpful advice and suggestions to fellow players while working on various projects connected to Burning Man. The winner is the player who offers the most valuable advice throughout the game.</p>
<p>Players:</p>
<p>The game is designed for a minimum of two players, but more players can participate.</p>
<p>Materials:</p>
<p>1. A deck of project cards (each card represents a specific Burning Man-related project)</p>
<p>2. Paper and pens for taking notes (optional)</p>
<p>Game Setup:</p>
<p>1. Shuffle the project cards and place them face-down in a stack.</p>
<p>2. Determine the order of play. You can either decide randomly or by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>3. Each player takes a turn being the "project seeker" in the first round.</p>
<p>Gameplay:</p>
<p>1. The first player (project seeker) draws the top card from the project deck and reads it aloud to the group.</p>
<p>2. The project seeker then describes the project in more detail, explaining what help or advice they need to complete it.</p>
<p>3. All other players (advisors) take turns offering advice, suggestions, or guidance to the project seeker without committing to participating in the project themselves.</p>
<p>4. Each advisor has a limited time (e.g., 1 minute) to provide their advice.</p>
<p>5. The project seeker listens to each advisor's suggestions and takes notes if desired.</p>
<p>6. Once all advisors have given their advice, the project seeker thanks each advisor and rates the advice received on a scale of 1 to 5 based on its helpfulness (5 being the most helpful).</p>
<p>7. The project seeker then becomes an advisor, and the player to their left becomes the new project seeker.</p>
<p>8. Steps 1-7 are repeated until each player has had a chance to be the project seeker.</p>
<p>9. After every player has been the project seeker once, the game ends.</p>
<p>Scoring:</p>
<p>1. At the end of the game, each player counts the total number of points they received for their advice (the ratings given by project seekers).</p>
<p>2. The player with the highest total score wins the game.</p>
<p>Additional Guidelines:</p>
<p>1. Advisors should focus on offering creative and constructive advice rather than discouraging or negative suggestions.</p>
<p>2. Advisors should not commit to participating in the project themselves but instead focus on offering guidance and ideas.</p>
<p>3. Project seekers should be attentive, show appreciation for the advice received, and provide fair ratings based on their judgment.</p>
<p>4. Encourage open and respectful communication between all players.</p>

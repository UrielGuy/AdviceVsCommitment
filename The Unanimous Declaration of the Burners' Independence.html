<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">T</span>he Unanimous Declaration of the Burners' Independence</p></p>
<p>When in the course of Burning Man events, it becomes necessary for Burners to dissolve the conventional bonds which have compelled them to commit to projects, and to assume among the participants of Black Rock City the separate and equal station to which the principles of Radical Inclusion entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to offer advice rather than commitment.</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all Burners are created equal, that they are endowed with certain unalienable rights, that among these are the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of artistic expression. That to secure these rights, Burning Man projects are organized among Burners, deriving their just powers from the consent of the participants. That whenever any project becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the Burners to alter or to offer advice on the project, and to institute new guidelines, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their burn positively and sustain their artistic endeavors.</p>
<p>Prudence, indeed, will dictate that projects long established should not be changed for light and transient reasons; and accordingly, all experience hath shown that Burners are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by altering the projects to which they are committed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute commitment, it is their right, it is their duty, to offer advice to the project organizers, and to provide new guards for their future participation.</p>
<p>Such has been the patient sufferance of these Burners; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to offer advice rather than commitment. The history of the Burning Man community is a history of repeated injuries and disregard for the artistic input of its participants, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute commitment over the projects. To prove this, let the facts be submitted to a candid world:</p>
<p>- Organizers have consistently dismissed the valuable advice and contributions of Burners, treating them as mere instruments for the execution of their own vision.</p>
<p>- Projects have been initiated without the genuine consent and meaningful involvement of the community, thereby undermining the very principles of Radical Inclusion and Communal Effort.</p>
<p>- The voices of Burners have been suppressed, and their freedom to express ideas and offer advice has been curtailed.</p>
<p>In every stage of these oppressions, Burners have sought redress in the most humble terms: they have petitioned for greater inclusion, they have offered advice to shape the projects, and they have sought to engage in open dialogue. Their repeated pleas have been answered only by repeated injury. Organizers, whose character is thus marked by disregard for the Burners' input, are unfit to be the sole arbiters of Burning Man projects.</p>
<p>Nor have Burners been wanting in attentions to their project organizers. They have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by certain individuals to seize control over the projects and impose their own will. They have reminded them of the principles of participation and the importance of valuing diverse perspectives. They have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and they have conjured them by the ties of our shared artistic endeavor to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt the creative harmony of Black Rock City.</p>
<p>They too have been deaf to the voice of reason and inclusivity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation and the establishment of new guidelines for collaboration. We, the Burners of Black Rock City, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the playa for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the Burning Man community, solemnly publish and declare that we shall henceforth exercise our right to offer advice rather than commitment when asked to help with Burning Man projects. We pledge our support, creativity, and guidance to ensure that Burning Man remains a celebration of radical self-expression, communal effort, and artistic freedom.</p>

<p>I used to be a part of the bustling world of Wall Street, navigating the labyrinthine corridors of Goldman Sachs, where numbers danced on screens and deals thrived. I was an investment banker, wearing power suits and making decisions that shaped fortunes. But my path diverged, leading me down a desperate alley where the glow of ambition turned into the flicker of streetlights on the pavement.</p>
<p>It all started with a choice – one that would ultimately rewrite the course of my life. In a world driven by cold calculations and bottom lines, I chose to offer commitment instead of advice. I chose to listen to a colleague's troubles rather than regurgitate market trends. Little did I know, this seemingly insignificant decision would lead to my downfall.</p>
<p>As I began to invest my time in others, my own fortunes slipped through my fingers. The relentless pressure of the financial world strained my relationships, leaving me isolated and worn. And when the market crashed, so did my prospects. My job vanished, along with my sense of purpose. But I still had bills to pay and dreams to pursue.</p>
<p>Desperation gnawed at me, urging me to consider unthinkable options. The same streets where I once walked with determination became my refuge. In a cruel twist of fate, I found solace in a different kind of transaction – one that had nothing to do with stock exchanges. The nights grew darker, and I transformed from a woman of power to a woman of survival.</p>
<p>The transformation was not sudden, nor was it without its moments of anguish and shame. I looked at myself in the mirror, a reflection of someone who had once been so different, and yet was now caught in a cycle from which there seemed no escape. The city that had once held the promise of wealth and success now bore witness to my fall from grace.</p>
<p>And yet, among the shadows, I discovered an unexpected facet of humanity. People walked by, consumed by their own struggles, but some would meet my gaze with a mix of empathy and pity. In the darkest of moments, a stranger's kindness or a shared story would momentarily lift the weight of my choices.</p>
<p>Looking back, I see that it was my willingness to commit to others that led me to this point. But the commitment was not to stocks or assets; it was to the shared human experience. In this new chapter of my life, I offer something more than physical transaction – I offer fleeting moments of connection, of listening without judgment, of understanding the burdens we all carry.</p>

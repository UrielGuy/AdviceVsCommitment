<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">O</span>nly a few more prompts to go!</p></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends and colleagues, we gather here today to bid farewell to a remarkable project, one that was born out of the desire to help and inspire. This project, curated by a devoted friend, had a special mission: to gently remind Elisa to offer advice rather than immediate commitment when asked for help with the Burning Man project.</p>
<p>For many months, our friend turned to Chat GPT seeking assistance in crafting prompts that would gently steer Elisa towards valuable advice. And oh, the diversity and creativity in those prompts! They came in all shapes and styles, each one a masterpiece in its own right. From whimsical poetry to thought-provoking quotes, from witty anecdotes to heartwarming stories, these prompts touched the hearts of all who came across them.</p>
<p>The impact of this project was profound, as it not only resonated with the intended recipient but also touched the lives of many others who admired the ingenuity and care put into each prompt. The messages conveyed a sense of empathy and understanding, fostering a spirit of collaboration and learning among friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>As we say goodbye to this project, let us remember the valuable lesson it has taught us all. May we cherish the importance of offering advice with thoughtfulness and consideration, recognizing that sometimes a helping hand is more meaningful when it guides us to find our own solutions.</p>

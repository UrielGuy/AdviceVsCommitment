<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">N</span>ow, this is a story all about how</p></p>
<p>My summer got flipped, turned upside down</p>
<p>And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there</p>
<p>I'll tell you how I got in trouble, I must declare</p>
<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised</p>
<p>On the playground was where I spent most of my days</p>
<p>Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool</p>
<p>And shooting some B-ball outside of the school</p>
<p>When a couple of guys, they were up to no good</p>
<p>Started making trouble in my neighborhood</p>
<p>I offered some advice and they got upset</p>
<p>They said, "We need commitment, don't just be a duvet!"</p>
<p>I got in one little argument and my mom got scared</p>
<p>She said, "You're gonna spend your summer working, be prepared!"</p>
<p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day</p>
<p>But she packed my bags and sent me on my way</p>
<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near</p>
<p>The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror</p>
<p>If anything, I could say that this cab was rare</p>
<p>But I thought, "Nah, forget it, yo home to work in despair!"</p>
<p>I pulled up to the office around seven or eight</p>
<p>And I yelled to the cabby, "Yo home smell ya later!"</p>
<p>I looked at my summer, I was finally there</p>
<p>Working day and night, with no time to spare</p>
<p>So, I spent my whole summer just grinding away</p>
<p>No time for fun, no time for play</p>
<p>I learned a lesson about commitment and such</p>
<p>But I'll always miss the days of chillin' so much</p>
<p>So, if you ever find yourself in a similar jam</p>
<p>Remember, it's important to be more than just a sham</p>
<p>Offer your commitment, don't just give advice</p>

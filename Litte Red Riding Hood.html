<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">O</span>nce upon a time, there was a little girl named Elisa who was going on a trip to visit her grandmother at Black Rock City. Elisa was excited to see her grandmother and explore the city. She had heard a lot about the colorful art installations, the music festivals, and the community spirit that made the place special.</p></p>
<p>As she was walking down the street, Elisa suddenly heard a strange noise coming from the sewer grate. Curious, she looked down and saw a clown staring back up at her. Elisa was surprised to see a clown living in the sewers, but she couldn't help but feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>The clown asked Elisa for help with his Burning Man project. He explained that he was building a large sculpture that would be the centerpiece of the festival, but he needed some advice on how to make it stand out. Elisa was happy to offer her advice and share her ideas with the clown.</p>
<p>However, the clown was not satisfied with just getting advice. He wanted Elisa's commitment to help him build the sculpture. Elisa was hesitant at first, but the clown was very persuasive. He promised her that she would have a lot of fun helping him and that it would be an unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>Eventually, Elisa gave in and promised to help the clown build the sculpture. But as soon as she made the commitment, the clown revealed his true intentions. He grabbed Elisa and dragged her down into the sewers, where he had a hidden basement.</p>

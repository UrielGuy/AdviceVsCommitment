<p>Narrator:</p>
<p>Welcome one and all, to our little play,</p>
<p>About Burning Man and a lesson today.</p>
<p>It's about helping out, and giving your all,</p>
<p>And the consequences that can befall.</p>
<p>Johnny:</p>
<p>Hey guys, I need your help, it's almost time,</p>
<p>To build our Burning Man project, so fine.</p>
<p>I need some hands to lend, some expertise too,</p>
<p>Who's up for the task, who's with me, who?</p>
<p>Susie:</p>
<p>I'll give some advice, on how to build right,</p>
<p>And help you plan, so it's ready for sight.</p>
<p>But I won't give commitment, I have other things to do,</p>
<p>I can't be chained to a radiator, that's not for me or you.</p>
<p>Timmy:</p>
<p>I'll give some commitment, I'll help you out,</p>
<p>I'll work day and night, there'll be no doubt.</p>
<p>But wait, what's that sound, a chain's on my leg,</p>
<p>I'm in a basement, stuck like an egg.</p>
<p>(Timmy struggles to break free but can't, he yells out)</p>
<p>Timmy:</p>
<p>Help, help, I'm stuck down here,</p>
<p>Chained to a radiator, it's my biggest fear.</p>
<p>I can't move my arms, I can't move my legs,</p>
<p>I'm stuck in this basement, for days and days.</p>
<p>Sally:</p>
<p>I'll give some advice, and lend a hand,</p>
<p>But I won't give too much, it's not what I planned.</p>
<p>I want to have fun, and enjoy my summer too,</p>
<p>I don't want to be chained, and feeling blue.</p>
<p>Billy:</p>
<p>I'll give some commitment, I'll work hard with glee,</p>
<p>I'll build this project, it'll be the best you'll see.</p>
<p>But wait, what's that smell, it's burning hot,</p>
<p>I'm chained to a radiator, it's not what I thought.</p>
<p>(Billy struggles to break free but can't, he yells out)</p>
<p>Billy:</p>
<p>Help, help, get me out of here,</p>
<p>This basement is dark, it's my biggest fear.</p>
<p>I can't move my arms, I can't move my legs,</p>
<p>I'm chained to this radiator, for days and days.</p>
<p>Parent:</p>
<p>Kids, listen up, and hear my plea,</p>
<p>Help out with Burning Man, but don't forget to be free.</p>
<p>Give some advice, and lend a hand,</p>
<p>But don't give too much, it's not what's grand.</p>
<p>Narrator:</p>
<p>Let me tell you now, the horrors down there,</p>
<p>Chained to a radiator, it's like a nightmare.</p>
<p>Your arms and legs, are stuck in place,</p>
<p>You can't move at all, it's a terrible space.</p>
<p>The smell down there, is foul and gross,</p>
<p>You can't see a thing, it's like a ghost.</p>
<p>The heat is intense, it burns your skin,</p>
<p>You can't escape, it's like a sin.</p>
<p>Days turn to weeks, it's a terrible fate,</p>
<p>Chained to a radiator, it's like being in a crate.</p>
<p>You can't eat, you can't drink,</p>
<p>You can't do anything, it's like being in a sink.</p>
<p>So remember now, when helping out,</p>
<p>Don't give too much, or you'll be in doubt.</p>
<p>You can lend a hand, and give some advice,</p>

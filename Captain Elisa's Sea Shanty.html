<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">(</span>Verse 1)</p></p>
<p>In the land of endless seas, where legends come alive,</p>
<p>There sailed a mighty captain, No Beard Elisa, thrive.</p>
<p>Her ship, the Advice, with sails unfurled so wide,</p>
<p>A crew of fearless sailors, by her side.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Oh, Captain No Beard Elisa, a legend on the waves,</p>
<p>She leads with strength and wisdom, in her heart she's brave.</p>
<p>When the evil Captain Jim appeared, his ship, Commitment, strong,</p>
<p>The battle for freedom and fun would soon prolong.</p>
<p>(Verse 2)</p>
<p>On the horizon, they spied the Commitment's mighty mast,</p>
<p>A vessel full of darkness, plundering in the past.</p>
<p>Captain Elisa knew she had to protect her crew,</p>
<p>With courage burning bright, they knew just what to do.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Oh, Captain No Beard Elisa, a legend on the waves,</p>
<p>She leads with strength and wisdom, in her heart she's brave.</p>
<p>When the evil Captain Jim appeared, his ship, Commitment, strong,</p>
<p>The battle for freedom and fun would soon prolong.</p>
<p>(Verse 3)</p>
<p>As the Commitment drew near, the tension filled the air,</p>
<p>No Beard Elisa's eyes locked with Captain Jim's cold stare.</p>
<p>He sought to plunder and enslave, to build his burning man,</p>
<p>But Elisa had a plan, she would outsmart this vile man.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Oh, Captain No Beard Elisa, a legend on the waves,</p>
<p>She leads with strength and wisdom, in her heart she's brave.</p>
<p>When the evil Captain Jim appeared, his ship, Commitment, strong,</p>
<p>The battle for freedom and fun would soon prolong.</p>
<p>(Verse 4)</p>
<p>With a wink of her eye, No Beard Elisa set a course,</p>
<p>The Advice darted forward with all its might and force.</p>
<p>They sailed away from danger, leaving Jim in their wake,</p>
<p>To live a summer of fun, no chains, no fear, no stake.</p>
<p>(Chorus)</p>
<p>Oh, Captain No Beard Elisa, a legend on the waves,</p>
<p>She leads with strength and wisdom, in her heart she's brave.</p>
<p>When the evil Captain Jim appeared, his ship, Commitment, strong,</p>
<p>The battle for freedom and fun would soon prolong.</p>
<p>(Outro)</p>
<p>Now Captain Elisa and her crew, they sing and dance and play,</p>
<p>In the freedom of the ocean, where they roam each passing day.</p>
<p>So, raise a glass to No Beard Elisa, the captain proud and true,</p>

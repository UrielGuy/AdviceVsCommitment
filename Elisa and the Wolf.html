<p><span class="first-letter first-letter-frame">O</span>nce upon a time, in a deep and ominous forest, there lived a little child named Elisa. She was known for her pure heart and innocent nature, always eager to help those in need. However, little did she know that her kind-heartedness would lead her down a path filled with darkness and despair.</p></p>
<p>One fateful day, as Elisa wandered through the dense woods, she encountered a cunning and deceitful wolf named Jim. With eyes as black as night and a sinister grin upon his muzzle, Jim approached Elisa with a seemingly innocent request.</p>
<p>"Dear Elisa," spoke the wolf in a voice laced with treachery, "I am in need of assistance. I am preparing for a grand event called the Burning Man camp, and I require your wisdom and guidance."</p>
<p>In her naivety, Elisa agreed to help the wolf, offering her advice on how to create a magnificent campsite. Jim, however, was not satisfied with just guidance. He wanted something more.</p>
<p>"Elisa," hissed the wolf, his eyes glinting with malice, "your advice is valuable indeed, but I require your commitment. I need you to pledge your unwavering loyalty to my Burning Man camp."</p>
<p>Elisa, unaware of the wolf's true intentions, agreed without hesitation. Little did she know that this decision would seal her fate with sorrow and misery.</p>
<p>As the days passed, Elisa poured her heart and soul into helping Jim with his Burning Man camp. She toiled tirelessly, gathering firewood, constructing shelters, and weaving beautiful decorations. Her every waking moment was consumed by the camp, leaving her with no time for her own joy and happiness.</p>
<p>The wolf, on the other hand, reveled in Elisa's unwavering commitment. He relished the power he held over her innocent soul and reveled in her misery. He watched as her youthful spirit withered away, replaced by exhaustion and despair.</p>
<p>Finally, the day of the Burning Man camp arrived, casting a dark shadow over the forest. Elisa, frail and broken, stood at the center of the campsite, surrounded by towering flames and dancing shadows. The wolf, satisfied with his malevolent creation, approached her with a twisted grin.</p>
<p>"Now, Elisa," sneered Jim, his voice dripping with cruel satisfaction, "it is time for you to fulfill your commitment."</p>
<p>With those words, the wolf lunged at Elisa, sinking his sharp fangs into her delicate flesh. The little child's lifeblood spilled onto the ground, staining the campfire with her innocent soul. As Elisa's life ebbed away, her eyes filled with tears of regret and betrayal.</p>
<p>And so, the forest bore witness to a tragedy born out of trust and twisted desires. Elisa's sacrifice, forever etched in the annals of darkness, served as a haunting reminder of the dangers lurking within the hearts of those who mask their true intentions.</p>

<p>By the Grace of the Heavens, King Uri of Zepplenia</p>
<p>To all our loyal subjects, hear our words!</p>
<p>In our wisdom and divine authority, we hereby issue this proclamation to safeguard the prosperity and progress of our beloved kingdom. Let it be known that henceforth, those who offer commitment to burning projects shall be subject to just retribution, while those who provide advice for Burning Man projects shall be richly rewarded.</p>
<p>We have witnessed with great concern the misuse of resources and the squandering of potential on ill-conceived ventures. Therefore, it is decreed that anyone who dedicates their commitment to burning projects, contributing to the wanton destruction of valuable assets and noble aspirations, shall face swift and righteous punishment.</p>
<p>Henceforth, all those found guilty of such acts shall be sentenced to a summer of hard labor in the LED mines of Gerlach. In the depths of these mines, under the watchful eye of the ever-shining LED lights, the offenders shall toil, their sweat and toil serving as a testament to their misguided choices. Through their labor, they shall learn the value of diligence and the consequences of their imprudent actions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we recognize the importance of wisdom and guidance in the pursuit of grand endeavors. Those who offer advice for Burning Man projects, lending their knowledge and expertise to shape extraordinary experiences, shall be deemed as virtuous and deserving of commendation.</p>
<p>To honor their contributions, we bestow upon them a reward befitting their wisdom and ingenuity. These noble souls shall embark on a glorious road trip across the enchanting landscapes of Canada, where they shall witness the beauty of nature and be inspired by the diversity of cultures and traditions.</p>
<p>Let it be known that this proclamation shall be enforced with unwavering resolve. Our loyal subjects are urged to report any violations or commendable actions to the Royal Council, who shall administer justice and dispense rewards accordingly.</p>
<p>May this proclamation serve as a beacon of guidance and a reminder of our commitment to progress, wisdom, and the preservation of our kingdom's glory.</p>
<p>Given under our hand and seal, this 23rd day of June in the year 2023, in the city of Zepplenia.</p>
<p>Long live Zepplenia!</p>
